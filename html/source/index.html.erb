				<h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
				<p>I'm a front end web developer who loves building accessible, user friendly websites, crafting, and birds. I can be found learning about the latest web technologies, cycling along the seafront, or singing with The Dulcetones. I was touched by a humboldt penguin at Artis, Amsterdam, and have been elated ever since.</p>
				<p>I graduated from the University of Sussex with a Masters degree in Computing with Digital Media, and for the past 6 years have been developing websites in Brighton and London.</p>
				<p>I am available for freelance work.</p>
