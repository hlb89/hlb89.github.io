                    <h3>Buy My Audi</h3>
                    <p>Buy My Audi is a product that allows customers to view a wide range of brand new, unregistered Audi's already in stock. 
                    Once the customer has chosen a vehicle it can be reserved online, and they can then choose to apply for finance with Volkswagen Financial Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>VWFS required an update to the look and feel of Buy My Audi, as well as some functional changes based on feedback from UX workshops. My task was to update the 
                        styling and design new elements based on the provided Sketch designs, and update the existing Angular project with new functionality. As my first Angular project this was 
                        an exciting challenge and a great learning experience.
